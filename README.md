This is a toy project, with the goal of teaching a Deep Neural Network to play Snake.
The project is very much still in progress and needs a lot of work!

Please play around with the settings, or even write entierly new code. You can also
just have a look on how pretrained networks perform.

The code was written on Python 3.7.7 with the following modules:
-numpy
-tensorflow 2.2.0 (GPU support recomended)
-pygame 1.9.6

Simplest way to create a sutable environment using conda on Ubuntu:
1. Install conda
2. run: conda create -n snake_dql python=3.7 keras-gpu numpy
3. activate the newly created environment with: conda activate snake_dql
4. install pgame: pip install pygame
5. done
